# Project Description  

We made a Gym Help Line Agent. We implemented features such as name recognition, sentiment analysis, stemming and POS tagging in Asssignment 3. For my individual submission I have implemented the Google Translate API as well as the Google Maps Distance Matrix API to create a language option function and an ability to return distance from the gym if requested.

# Documentation

All documentation for the individual submission has been added to the top of the Read Me in the documentation folder.
