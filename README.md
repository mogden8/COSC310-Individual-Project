# Project Description  

Our goal is to make a Gym Helpline agent. A user may have a variety of questions about a gym and we hope the agent may act as a supplement to a “Frequently Asked Questions” page. Information provided by the agent can be one of several simple topics, such as, available trainers, equipment provided, opening and closing hours and other services provided by the gym. This will allow the gym to provide answers to potential clients without having one or more human agents on call at times.
